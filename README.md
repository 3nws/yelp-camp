This was a project for a web dev course taught by Colt Steele.
YelpCamp was created using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

I am trying to implement whatever feature I can think of to better understand back-end development.


## To try it:

Install MongoDB [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

Install Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install all the dependencies run `npm init`.

Make sure mongo is running.

And run `node app.js` or `nodemon app.js`.

Nodemon will restart the server everytime you make a change.
